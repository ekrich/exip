    <ul>
       <li>Summary - EXI Processor (EXIP) project's aim is to provide a C library for parsing and serialization of Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format streams. The focus is portability and efficiency for embedded systems development.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
       <li>Motivation - As the EXI is almost certainly becoming a W3C standard the only open source implementation of parser available is EXIficient. It is written in Java, not quite mature yet and depends on XML parser libraries. This makes it inappropriate for embedded systems development where the EXI format is expected to make big impact similarly to how XML standard is now used in almost all enterprise applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
       <li>Project stage - System design</li>
